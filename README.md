# Fit-to-Scrape
A web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news.

Whenever a user visits the site, the app will scrap events from reddit, buzzfeed and cnet. Each scraped article should be saved to the application database. The app should scrape and display the following information for each article:
Headline - the title of the event
URL - the url to the original event

Users can leave comments on the events displayed and revisit them later. The comments will be saved to the database as well and associated with their events. Users will be able to delete comments left on events. All stored comments should be visible to every user.
